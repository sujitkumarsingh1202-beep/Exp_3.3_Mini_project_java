Mini Project

Title: Online Student Management System Using Spring and Hibernate
Objective:
To develop a Spring and Hibernate-based mini project that demonstrates:

Dependency Injection using Spring Java-based configuration
CRUD operations using Hibernate ORM
Transaction Management for fee payment and refund operations
Integration of Spring + Hibernate for real-world data management
Project Overview:
The Online Student Management System allows users (admin or staff) to manage students, their enrolled courses, and fee payments. The system provides a user-friendly interface (console or web) to perform operations such as adding students, enrolling in courses, updating student data, deleting records, and handling payments and refunds while ensuring data consistency through transaction management.

Modules and Concepts Covered:
Module	Description
Student-Course Management	Demonstrates Dependency Injection using Spring Java-based configuration where Student depends on a Course.
CRUD Operations	Use Hibernate to perform Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on Student and Course entities.
Fee Payment & Refund	Implement Transaction Management using @Transactional in Spring. Ensure atomicity of payment or refund.
Spring + Hibernate Integration	Demonstrate how Spring handles services and Hibernate handles persistence logic in layered architecture.
Explanation of Project Functionality:
Dependency Injection (DI):

Define Student, Course, and FeeService as beans using @Configuration and @Bean.
Inject Course into Student and FeeService into the service layer.
CRUD Operations:

Admin can:

Add a new student
Assign a course to a student
Update student records (name, course, etc.)
Delete student records
View all enrolled students or a specific student
Implemented using Hibernate sessions and annotated entity classes.

Transaction Management:

Add a module for fee payment and refund:

Deduct amount from student balance on payment.
Refund on cancellation.
Ensure the transaction is rolled back if any failure occurs during multi-step operations.

Required Items for the Mini Project

MySQL (or H2 database)
Maven/Gradle (for dependency management)
IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (IDE)
Postman or Browser (if using web interface)
2. Java Classes
Student (Model)
Course (Model)
FeeService (Service layer)
StudentDAO (Data Access Layer)
AppConfig (Java-based Spring Configuration using @Configuration)
MainApp or Controller (Main class for interaction)
3. Database Tables
students (student_id, name, course_id, balance)
courses (course_id, course_name, duration)
payments (payment_id, student_id, amount, date)
4. Configuration Files
hibernate.cfg.xml or Hibernate Java Config
Spring AppConfig.java with @Bean for DAO, services, and entities
5. Features to Include
Console-based or web-based interface for:

Menu-driven options to choose operations
